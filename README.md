# Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are very important for Interviews. Most of the top companies prefer to ask question related to DSA. Leetcode is a great platform to practice newer problems of DSA. It has many features like sorting questions based on difficulty level, different companies, etc. Practicing Questions are very important to get a strong hold on DSA.
But what will happen if you stuck in the middle of a question?!
That's where our solutions come to rescue :)
We have tried to curate solutions for majority questions so that you could ace your interview rounds!
** KEEP PRACTICING, KEEP LEARNING!! **
