Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

1. Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
2. Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.


Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
Output: true


Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
Output: false
