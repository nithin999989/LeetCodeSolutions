Percentage of Letter in String

    Given a string s and a character letter, return the percentage of characters in s that equal letter rounded down to the nearest whole percent.

    

    Example 1:

        Input: s = "foobar", letter = "o"
        Output: 33
        Explanation:
        The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'o' is 2 / 6 * 100% = 33% when rounded down, so we return 33.

    Example 2:

        Input: s = "jjjj", letter = "k"
        Output: 0
        Explanation:
        The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'k' is 0%, so we return 0.
    

    Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 100
        s consists of lowercase English letters.
        letter is a lowercase English letter.
